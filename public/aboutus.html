                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p id="box-text">uNote is a collaborative note-taking tool that focuses on making things easy and keeping your notes organized. We started developing uNote in April 2024 and wrapped it up by July. Our goal was to create something simple and accessible for everyone, whether you're working solo or with a team. With uNote, you can brainstorm, plan, and keep track of your tasks all in one place. It's designed to help you work together smoothly and keep your ideas safe and sound. Give uNote a try and see how it can make your note-taking experience better.
